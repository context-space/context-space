**Context Space is a production-ready infrastructure layer for Context Engineering, making it easy to seamlessly adopt MCP servers and connect AI agents to external data and services.** While the industry focuses on prompt engineering, we believe the next frontier lies in Context Engineering that provides AI systems with the right information, at the right time, in the right format.

## What is Context Engineering?

As Andrej Karpathy recently [noted](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1937902205765607626), context engineering is becoming the foundation for reliable AI systems that can operate in complex, real-world environments.

**Context engineering** is the systematic design and management of all information surrounding an AI model during inference. Context engineering builds upon and extends prompt engineering. While [prompt engineering](https://blog.langchain.com/context-engineering-for-agents/) optimizes *what* you say to the model, context engineering governs what the model knows when it generates a response.

**Key Components:**
- System Instructions - Rules and examples that guide model behavior
- Dynamic Memory - Conversation history and persistent knowledge
- Retrieved Information - Real-time data from documents, APIs, and databases
- Available Tools - Functions the model can use (search, send_email, etc.)
- User State - Preferences, context, and session information

## Start Context Engineering with Context Space

When [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) appeared in late 2024, the vision was spot-on: a standardized way for AI tools to securely access external data and services. MCP represented a breakthrough in thinking about how AI agents should interact with the world.

Recognizing MCP as the perfect foundation, we built Context Space to extend its vision into production-ready infrastructure. 

Today, Context Space delivers a secure integration layer with persistent credential management. Guided by MCP‚Äôs principles, we are expanding this foundation into a complete context engineering platform for the next generation of AI.

## Roadmap: From Foundation to Frontier

Our development is structured in clear phases, evolving from the robust production foundation available today to the intelligent context engine of tomorrow.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 1: Production-Ready Foundation (Available Now)
The initial phase solves the most critical challenges of using context protocols in production environments, delivering a stable, secure, and scalable infrastructure.

| Challenge in Production | The Context Space Solution |
| :----- | :----- |
| Manual, Insecure Credential Handling | **One-Click OAuth & Vault Security:**<br>Connect to 14+ services with secure OAuth flows, backed by HashiCorp Vault for enterprise-grade credential management. |
| Inconsistent and Complex APIs | **A Single, Unified RESTful API:**<br>Interact with all services through one clean, consistent, and reliable API that you'll actually enjoy using. |
| Complex Deployment & Scattered MCP Servers | **Unified Context Plane with Tool Aggregation:**<br>Connect once, and access everything. Manage all capabilities from a single mcp server endpoint. |


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Phase 2: The Intelligent Context Layer ( In Development)

Building on this foundation, our future work focuses on enabling more advanced AI capabilities. 

**Roadmap Timeline:**

|Timeline | Key Features | MCP Integration |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Next 6 months | Native MCP Support, Context Memory, Smart Aggregation | Full MCP protocol compatibility |
| 6-12 months | Semantic Retrieval, Context Optimization, Real-time Updates | Enhanced MCP tool capabilities |
| 12+ months | Context Synthesis, Predictive Loading, AI Context Reasoning | Advanced MCP ecosystem features |
