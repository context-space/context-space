# Getting Started with Integrations

This guide will walk you through connecting your first Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to Context Space.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Context Space account
- Access to the integration you want to connect
- Required API keys or credentials (if applicable)

## Step 1: Browse Available Integrations

1. Navigate to the [Integrations page](/integrations)
2. Browse through available integrations or use the search functionality
3. Click on an integration to view its details

## Step 2: Connect Your Integration

### OAuth-based Integrations

For integrations that support OAuth:

1. Click the **Connect with OAuth** button
2. Grant the required permissions
3. You'll be redirected back to Context Space once connected

### API Key-based Integrations

For integrations requiring API keys:

1. Click **Connect** and select **API Key**
2. Enter your API key in the provided field
3. Click **Save API Key** to establish the connection

```bash
# Example: Getting your API key (varies by service)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/keys
```

## Step 3: Test Your Connection

Once connected, you can:

1. View the integration in your **Connected Integrations** list
2. Test the connection using the **Playground** feature
3. Start building workflows with your new integration

## Next Steps

- [Explore the Playground](/docs/playground) to test your integrations
- [Build your first workflow](/docs/workflows/creating-workflows)
- [Manage integration permissions](/docs/integrations/permissions)

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Failed

If your connection fails:

1. Verify your API key or credentials are correct
2. Check that you have the required permissions
3. Ensure the service is not experiencing downtime

### Missing Permissions

Some integrations require specific permissions:

- Review the permission requirements on the integration page
- Update your OAuth permissions if needed
- Contact the service provider if you need additional access
