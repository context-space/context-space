# Smart Issue Classification Bot: A Real MCP Success Story

## My Story: From Overwhelmed Maintainer to Automation Advocate

As an open-source project maintainer, I was constantly overwhelmed by the flood of GitHub issues. Every day, I faced dozens of new reports—some were bugs, others were feature requests, and many were just questions. Manually triaging and labeling these issues was time-consuming and error-prone. I knew there had to be a smarter way.

## The Pain Point: Manual Issue Management

The core problem was clear: manual triage of GitHub issues was inefficient and unsustainable. Important bugs were often buried under unrelated questions, and contributors sometimes waited days for a response. The lack of structure made it difficult to prioritize, assign, or even search for similar issues. As the project grew, so did the chaos.

## The Solution: Discovering MCP and Building a GitHub Issue Bot

Everything changed when I discovered the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP offered a standardized way for AI agents to interact with tools like GitHub, making it possible to automate workflows that previously required human judgment. I realized I could build a smart GitHub issue bot—one that could classify, label, and even route issues automatically.

### Implementation Process

1. **Integration with Context Space**
   I chose Context Space, the leading MCP marketplace, for its ready-to-use GitHub integration and secure credential management. Connecting my bot to the repository took just minutes.

2. **Workflow Design**
   - The bot listens for new issues via GitHub webhooks.
   - It fetches the issue content and relevant metadata.
   - Using an LLM via MCP, the bot analyzes the issue and predicts its type—bug, feature, question, or discussion.
   - Based on the classification, the bot applies the correct labels and notifies the right team members.
   - If uncertain, the bot flags the issue for human review and learns from corrections over time.

3. **Deployment and Feedback**
   I deployed the bot and monitored its performance, collecting feedback from contributors and team members to refine its accuracy.

## The Results: Real Impact, Real Numbers

The results were immediate and impressive:

- **80% reduction** in manual triage time.
- **95% accuracy** in issue classification after two weeks of feedback.
- **Faster response times**—contributors received the right attention within hours, not days.
- **Improved project health**—critical bugs surfaced quickly, and duplicate issues were automatically linked.

One contributor commented, "This is the first time I've seen a GitHub issue bot that actually understands what I'm reporting. It's a game-changer!"

## Lessons Learned: Why This is an MCP Success Story

Looking back, several factors made this project a true MCP success story:

- **Standardization**: MCP's unified protocol meant I didn't have to write custom code for every API call.
- **Security**: Context Space's credential management gave me peace of mind.
- **Scalability**: As the project grew, I could easily add new workflows—like auto-assigning reviewers or escalating urgent bugs.
- **Community**: With over 1000 developers using Context Space, I found support and inspiration at every step.
