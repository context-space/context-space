# I Saved 20 Hours Per Week Using These Developer Productivity Tools

## The Problem: Drowning in Busywork

As a developer working in a fast-paced tech team, I found myself constantly bogged down by repetitive tasks, context switching, and inefficient workflows. Between code reviews, bug tracking, documentation, and endless meetings, my actual coding time was shrinking week by week. I knew I needed a change—something to help me reclaim my focus and productivity.

## Choosing the Right Tools

I started researching the best developer time saving tools and coding productivity tips recommended by top engineers. My goal was to find solutions that would automate routine work, streamline collaboration, and help me stay in the flow. After testing dozens of options, I settled on a toolkit that included:

- **Context Space** for unified integrations and workflow automation
- **VS Code Extensions** (like GitLens, Prettier, and TabNine) for smarter editing
- **Linear** for fast, keyboard-driven issue tracking
- **Notion** for centralized documentation and knowledge sharing
- **Slack Bots** for automated notifications and reminders
- **Zapier** for connecting apps and automating multi-step processes

## Implementation: Putting Productivity into Practice

1. **Automating Repetitive Tasks**
   I used Context Space to connect GitHub, Slack, and Linear, automating notifications, code review assignments, and status updates. Zapier helped me set up triggers for routine actions, like moving issues or sending reminders.

2. **Supercharging My Editor**
   With VS Code extensions, I reduced time spent on code formatting, navigation, and even code suggestions. TabNine's AI-powered completions made writing boilerplate a breeze.

3. **Streamlining Collaboration**
   Linear's keyboard shortcuts and Slack bots kept my team in sync without constant context switching. Notion became our single source of truth for docs, reducing time wasted searching for information.
