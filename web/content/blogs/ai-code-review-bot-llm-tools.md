# I Built an AI Code Review Bot in 2 Hours Using LLM Tools

## Project Background

As an AI developer and DevOps engineer, I've always wanted to automate the tedious parts of code review. With the rise of LLM GitHub integration and AI code review tools, I saw an opportunity to build a smart bot that could help my team catch bugs, suggest improvements, and speed up our development workflow. The challenge: could I build a working prototype in just two hours?

---

## Technical Approach

My goal was to create a bot that automatically reviews pull requests on GitHub, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding and code analysis. I chose Context Space for its seamless LLM GitHub integration, robust API, and ready-to-use MCP tools. The stack included:

- **Context Space** for unified LLM and GitHub operations
- **OpenAI GPT-4** as the review engine
- **GitHub Webhooks** to trigger the bot on new pull requests
- **Node.js** for orchestration and deployment

---

## Implementation Process

1. **Webhook Setup**
   I configured a GitHub webhook to notify my Node.js server whenever a new pull request was opened or updated.

2. **Fetching Code Changes**
   Using Context Space's GitHub integration, the bot fetched the diff and relevant metadata for each pull request.

3. **LLM-Powered Review**
   The code diff and PR context were sent to GPT-4 via Context Space's LLM API. I prompted the model to identify bugs, suggest improvements, and flag potential security issues.

4. **Automated Feedback**
   The bot parsed the LLM's response and posted a detailed review comment directly on the pull request, tagging the author and relevant reviewers.

5. **Continuous Learning**
   I added logic for the bot to learn from reviewer feedback, improving its suggestions over time.

## Results Showcase

- **Setup time:** 2 hours from scratch to working prototype
- **Review coverage:** 100% of new pull requests automatically analyzed
- **Bug detection:** The bot flagged two critical issues in the first day
- **Developer feedback:** Team members reported faster reviews and appreciated the actionable suggestions
- **Scalability:** The solution handled multiple repositories with minimal configuration

---

## Key Takeaways

- **LLM GitHub integration** dramatically accelerates AI code review automation.
- Using Context Space's unified API saved hours of boilerplate and authentication headaches.
- Even a simple prompt can yield valuable insights—iterative tuning makes the bot smarter over time.
- Automated code review doesn't replace humans, but it's a powerful assistant for catching issues early and improving code quality.
- The barrier to entry is lower than ever—if you're an AI developer or DevOps engineer, now is the perfect time to experiment.
