# Amap Adapter

This module provides a unified adapter for the Amap (Gaode Map) API in the Context-Space platform, supporting geocoding, route planning, administrative district queries, weather, and other LBS features.

## Features
- Address and coordinate conversion (geocoding/reverse geocoding)
- Route planning (walking, driving, transit, bicycling)
- Distance measurement
- Administrative district queries
- IP location
- Static map generation
- Coordinate system conversion
- Weather information query

## Quick Usage Example

```go
providerInfo := &domain.ProviderAdapterInfo{
    Identifier: "amap",
    Name:       "Amap API",
    AuthType:   providercore.AuthTypeAPIKey,
    Status:     providercore.ProviderStatusActive,
}
adapterConfig := &domain.AdapterConfig{Timeout: 10 * time.Second}
restConfig := &rest.RESTConfig{BaseURL: "https://restapi.amap.com"}
restAdapter := rest.NewRESTAdapter(providerInfo, adapterConfig, restConfig)
adapter := NewAmapAdapter(providerInfo, adapterConfig, restAdapter, "<YOUR_API_KEY>")

ctx := context.Background()
params := map[string]interface{}{"address": "Beijing Chaoyang District"}
result, err := adapter.Execute(ctx, "geocoding", params, nil)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
fmt.Println(result)
```

## API Key Configuration
- You must provide a valid Amap API Key when creating the adapter.
- It is recommended to store the API Key in a secure config file or environment variable.

## Testing

This module includes comprehensive unit tests covering all operations:

```bash
go test ./internal/provideradapter/infrastructure/adapters/amap -v
```

You can also run only the full integration test:

```bash
go test ./internal/provideradapter/infrastructure/adapters/amap -v -run TestAmapAdapter_AllOperations
```

## Notes
- All operations use GET requests. Parameters must conform to the official Amap API documentation.
- Some endpoints (such as static map, weather, etc.) have special parameter requirements. See manifest.json for details.
- The returned result is the original JSON structure from Amap. You may need to further parse it as needed.
