# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Context Space Project Contributor License Agreement

üéâ **Welcome to Context Space!** Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open source context engineering infrastructure.

This CLA helps us keep the project healthy and sustainable while protecting everyone's rights. It's similar to the CLAs used by many popular open source projects like Apache, Django, and Node.js.

### üìã **What this CLA does**
- Ensures the project can continue to evolve and be maintained
- Gives us the flexibility to adjust licensing if needed for the project's long-term success
- Protects both your rights and ours
- Keeps everything legally clear and simple

### 1. Definitions
- **"You"** means you, the person or organization contributing
- **"Contribution"** means any code, documentation, or other materials you submit to the project
- **"Project"** means the Context Space open source project

### 2. Your Grant of Rights
By contributing to Context Space, you give us permission to:

- **Use your contribution** in the project (copy, modify, distribute, etc.)
- **Relicense your contribution** under different license terms if needed for the project's sustainability or compatibility (for example, changing from AGPL to Apache license)
- **Include your contribution** in any future versions of the project under any license terms

**Important:** This doesn't change your ownership of your contribution - you still own it and can use it however you want!

### 3. What You Promise
You confirm that:
- You wrote the contribution yourself, or have permission to submit it
- Your contribution doesn't copy someone else's copyrighted work
- You have the right to give us these permissions

### 4. No Warranty
You're contributing your work "as is" - we all understand that open source contributions come without guarantees, and that's totally normal and expected.

### 5. Questions and Communication
If we have questions about your contribution, we might reach out to you. You're always welcome to participate in discussions, but it's completely voluntary.

## üåü **Why We Use a CLA**

We use this CLA because:
- üîÑ **Flexibility**: It lets us adjust the project's licensing if needed to ensure long-term sustainability
- üõ°Ô∏è **Protection**: It protects both contributors and the project from legal issues
- üöÄ **Growth**: It gives us the legal certainty needed to accept contributions and grow the project
- ü§ù **Community**: It creates a clear, fair framework for everyone who contributes

Many successful open source projects use CLAs for the same reasons - it's a proven way to keep projects healthy and growing while protecting everyone involved.

**Thank you for being part of the Context Space community!** üéâ
